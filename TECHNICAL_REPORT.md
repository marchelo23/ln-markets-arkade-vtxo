## 1. The Verification Algorithm & Security Properties

The implementation provides a **Zero-Trust** client-side verification pipeline. Given a VTXO outpoint received from the ASP, the SDK independently reconstructs and validates the full virtual transaction DAG without trusting any ASP-provided data.

### 1.1 DAG Reconstruction Algorithm

The core function `reconstructAndValidateVtxoDAG()` executes a multi-phase pipeline:

1. **Chain Discovery**: Fetches the VTXO chain from the IndexerService. Supports two modes: direct VTXO lookup (`getVtxoChain`) or privacy-preserving batch fetch (`getBatchVtxos`) where the client requests all chains in a commitment batch and filters locally.

2. **PSBT Parsing & TXID Verification**: Each virtual transaction PSBT is decoded using `@scure/btc-signer`. The computed `tx.id` is compared against the ASP-claimed txid — any mismatch throws `TXID_MISMATCH`.

3. **DAG Structural Validation**: For every node, `input[0]` must correctly reference the `txid:vout` of its ancestor. Value conservation is enforced: `sum(child outputs) == ancestor output[index]`. **Checkpoint transactions** are validated separately for sweep delay coherence and correct DAG integration.

4. **Cycle Detection (Ouroboros Protection)**: Before wiring relationships, each node path is traced to detect cycles. A specially crafted DAG that loops back to itself would trigger an `OUROBOROS_CYCLE_DETECTED` exception rather than an infinite loop.

5. **Signature Verification**: Every node's `tapKeySig` is verified via BIP 340 Schnorr verification against the BIP 341 tweaked public key. The sighash is computed using `preimageWitnessV1()` with full previous output context. Only `SIGHASH_DEFAULT` (0x00) and `SIGHASH_ALL` (0x01) are accepted — non-standard flags are rejected.

6. **Taproot Script Tree Verification** *(Tier 2)*: Merkle proofs are recomputed from tap leaf scripts and verified against the declared `tapMerkleRoot`. Ark exit policies are enforced: scripts must contain `CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY + CHECKSIG` (standard exit), `HASH160 + CHECKSIG` (swap claim), or `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY + CHECKSIG` (swap refund).

7. **Timelock Verification** *(Tier 2)*: All `nLockTime`, `nSequence`, `OP_CSV`, and `OP_CLTV` constraints are extracted and validated for internal consistency and satisfiability against the current blockchain state.

8. **Hash Preimage Verification** *(Tier 2)*: Scripts containing `OP_SHA256`, `OP_HASH160`, `OP_HASH256`, or `OP_RIPEMD160` conditions are verified against provided preimages. This is demonstrated on a Boltz submarine swap (Ark ↔ LN) scenario where `HASH160(preimage)` satisfies the HTLC claim leaf.

9. **On-chain Anchoring** *(Tier 1)*: The commitment transaction is fetched from a user-controlled Bitcoin node. The SDK verifies: (a) the transaction exists and is confirmed with sufficient depth, (b) the referenced output matches the expected script and amount, (c) confirmation depth satisfies the minimum threshold.

### 1.2 Security Properties

| Property | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Zero Trust** | Every ASP response is independently verified |
| **Anti-Mirage** | Raw tx hex is fetched and decoded; RPC responses validated |
| **Cycle Protection** | DFS-based cycle detection before relationship wiring |
| **Sighash Shield** | Only 0x00/0x01 accepted; 0x02, 0x81, etc. rejected |
| **Iterative Traversal** | Stack-based iteration prevents stack overflow on deep DAGs |
| **Orphan Detection** | Nodes unreachable from the anchoring leaf are rejected |

## 2. Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 2.1 Iterative vs. Recursive Traversal
All DAG traversals (signature verification, timelock checks, hash preimage verification) use iterative stack-based approaches. This prevents `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` on deep chains (tested up to depth=500). The trade-off is slightly more complex code, but guarantees deterministic resource usage.

### 2.2 Cryptographic Choices
- **AES-256-GCM** for exit data encryption: Provides authenticated encryption, preventing ciphertext manipulation attacks on stored exit transactions.
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** (100,000 iterations): Derives the storage encryption key from user entropy with brute-force resistance.
- **Native `node:crypto`**: Used exclusively for the storage layer to minimize supply chain attack surface.

### 2.3 Privacy-Preserving Fetch
The SDK supports batch-wide VTXO fetching where clients request all chains in a commitment batch rather than a specific outpoint. This prevents the ASP from learning which VTXO the client is verifying. Trade-off: increased bandwidth consumption.

### 2.4 Dependencies
Runtime dependencies are limited to the standard Arkade SDK stack: `@scure/btc-signer`, `@noble/curves`, `@noble/hashes`, and `@scure/base`. No additional third-party libraries are introduced.

## 3. Completed Tiers & Limitations

### 3.1 Tier 1: Core VTXO Chain Verification ✅
- **DAG Reconstruction**: Fully implemented with iterative traversal, cycle detection, and orphan rejection.
- **Signature Verification**: BIP 340 Schnorr verification with BIP 341 sighash computation and tweaked key validation.
- **Checkpoint Verification**: Structural coherence and sweep delay validation.
- **On-chain Anchoring**: Commitment confirmation, output script/amount matching, and depth verification via Bitcoin Core RPC or Electrum.

### 3.2 Tier 2: Full Script Satisfaction ✅
- **Taproot Script Trees**: Merkle proof verification and Ark exit policy enforcement.
- **Timelocks**: Comprehensive nLockTime, nSequence, CSV, and CLTV validation.
- **Hash Preimages**: SHA256, HASH160, HASH256, RIPEMD160 preimage verification. Demonstrated on a Boltz submarine swap HTLC with claim and refund script leaves.

### 3.3 Tier 3: Sovereign Unilateral Exit ✅
- **Data Identification**: `extractExitSequence()` traces the full path from anchoring leaf to VTXO root.
- **Local Storage**: `persistVtxoForExit()` encrypts and stores exit data via the SDK's storage adapter. `onReceiveVtxo()` automates this on VTXO receipt.
- **Exit Execution**: `executeSovereignExit()` broadcasts the full transaction sequence using only local data and a Bitcoin node — no ASP contact required.

### 3.4 Tier 4: Sentinel Protocol Frontend (Verification UI) ✅
- **Purpose**: A tactical React-based interface ("Sentinel Protocol") designed to visually demonstrate the Arkade SDK's VTXO verification pipeline.
- **Branding**: Integrates the "CVE (Chelo Verification Engine)" branding, serving as a robust, high-fidelity proof of the SDK's security and logic.
- **Core Views**:
  - **Command Center**: Overall status dashboard showing pipeline health, verification stats, and anchoring status.
  - **DAG Explorer**: Structural analysis and visualization of the reconstructed VTXO dependency graph.
  - **Signature Audit**: Signature Verification Audit ensuring cryptographic integrity of the paths.
  - **Sovereign Exit**: Visualizes the exit sequence and cryptographic guarantees for unilateral extraction.
  - **Live Terminal**: Real-time diagnostic terminal representing the verification pipeline log output.

### 3.5 Limitations
- **MuSig2 Key Aggregation**: The SDK verifies that signatures are valid against tweaked public keys but does not independently verify the n-of-n MuSig2 key aggregation ceremony. This would require access to individual signer public keys, which are not exposed by the current IndexerService API.
- **Regtest/Signet Scope**: Tested against regtest and signet structures. Mainnet deployment would benefit from BIP 157/158 (Neutrino) integration for trust-minimized on-chain verification.
- **Integration Testing**: The integration test against a live arkd instance requires a running local environment. Without arkd, the test skips gracefully.
